### Progress

while working towards MVP for our goDot project, there were many features and conpoments we had to learn, code and add into our game. For me, I worked on adding a player controller, so that the user can move , jump sprint and attack using the controls and the map of our game. My partner on the other hand, worked on adding the functionaality of the enemy, and creating the weapon the player holds. For the player controller, I imported a premade scene that includes the script but also the object and nodes of the characters. I had to make some adjustments to the script such as changing the speed of movements. I also had to learn how to connect the controls of the player to the scene. In other words, I had to add control names, and set each key on the keyboard (W A S D, space, etc) to the player. Figuring this out was hard since It required me to edit the scipyt and find out where exact I connect the controls. However, by using a tutorial video I was able to follow the steps in importing and setting the keybinds, allowing users to move the player. Moving on, creating the map for the game was way more difficult to understand and do. Not only did I have to figure out how exactly, the map should look, I had to know what assets I want, how to add it into the scene, and maksing sure the ratio/size of the assets are correct. Instead of creating my own assets, I decided to use kenney which provides premade asset packs that you can directly download and import into your files. When I have choosen a pack, I imported into my files system in goDot, after organizing the files and creating folders for models and assets. Since, the asset packs has hundreds of models, I had to preview and go through each scene to check whether or not I needed the assets before importing it into goDot. This took a long time, as I had to import each inidudally scenes into my folders. When I finally finished,
