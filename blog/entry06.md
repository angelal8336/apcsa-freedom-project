### Context
My partner Shelly and I created a 3D survival game called Endless enimes for fun. In this game you try to survive the longest without dying to the mobs while slaying them to gain as much point as possible. There is no escape and no goal besides gaining the highest score possible. The user controls the player using WASD, clicking and spacebar to move, hit and jump. The creation of this game was made using goDot engine with github workspace and assets stores.

After finishing the MVP, we were given time to add additional features to our project. Along with that, we had time to create in class slides, present and prepare for the EXPO. 

### Process Beyond MVP
After finishing my minimum viable product of goDot game, we had a few days to enhance our product before presentation in class and during the EXPO. With that time spand, we decided to:
* Create a scoreboard; with every monster defeated score increases by 1
* Add a deathscreen; When you die a new screen pops up

For the scoreboard, we created

### Takeaway from In-Class Presentation
We created a google slide that goes over our process, challenges, and takeaways so that we have something to present to the class during our in class presentation. From the class presentation, we had some takeaways not the ones on our slides but ones we realized after reviewing the journey to the presentations. The main takeaways are listed below with explaination. 
1. Communication is key. Not only did we have to communicate while working on the game together, we had to do it even more during the creation of our slides. A few days before the slides were due we would call on discord, text and leave comments for each other so that we know who is working and speaking on what. In order for us to organize our slides we had to actively speak to each other to change and revise anything we needed to. We even went far and gave intense feedback to each other for any missing images, words or ideas we should address in our presentation. Together we made sure everything was well planned, slides were done, and we are prepared to face the class and explain during our day. To perfect our speeches, we briefly went over a test run so that we memorized the general format of our ideas and slides so that we don't end up messing up during the real deal. Without any of communication with shelly through feedbacks or simply talking while working we would defintely not have been as confident and able to speak to the class, let alone even complete our slides. That is why we believe communication is key because it was the building stone of our sucessful presentation we gave in class.
2. When you miss up or forget Inprovise. You have no idea how much times we miss up or forgot what to say during our presentation. It was more times than my fingers can count. When it did happen, we came up with something to say on the spot instead of making a big deal out of it. Since, we were aware of our slide order and a general idea of what we wanted to say, we were able to phrase our words to continue our speech. We were nervous whenever we messed up but we continued to speak and regain our words to give a clear presentation. In fact we probably improvised most of our presentation because of the nerves that got to us. Even then, we were able to sucessful give a good presentation to the class and for them not to even notice when we messed up. This is why we believe that if you do mess up or forgot just find words to say that relates because it's better than stopping. If we stopped ever time and made a deal of it then we would have not been able to deliever a well thought out presentation or in the worst case be cut off by the bell or teacher.
3. Speak slowly, clearly and pause. When we went up in front of the class, it is easy to forget to speak slowly and clearly as we want to quickly finish this. However, it is important to slow down your speech and to project your words so that the audience is able to understand what your saying. If your going to present than deal with the nervousness and try your best to deliever your thoughts the best you can to the people. If people don't understand what your saying then they will be lost and that is not what we want. For us, we tried our best to do this and eventually we did as we calm down the nerves by telling ourselves it is okay. Another important thing we learned is to pause. When we were speaking, we should of paused more often to gather our thoughts and also to let the class process what we just said. Pausing allows us to calm down and think before we spoke again which was important since it decreases stuttering and also allows us to be more confident in the class. IF we never attempt to do any of this, our presentation would of been super bad as we were be speeding through it, not giving time for ourselves to think and untliemy fail to deliever our product and process. This is why we believe this is an important takeaways because in life when were presentation or speaking we need to be able to do this.
