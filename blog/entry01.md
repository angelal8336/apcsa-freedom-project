For this year's freedom project, I decided to create a open world game revolved around a mini version of society that involves farming, beating opponments, and stories with my partner Shelly. It will be a game similar to stardew village, as it was part of inspiration. I want to create this game using the tool, goDot. goDot is a free game engine that allows for pixeled creation in 2D or 3D. The reason I picked this appilcation was because one, I was intested in creating pixel games, and two it was the only engine that caught my attention. When I first started this freedom project, I was made to choose what I wanted to create, and what tool I would want to use. I brainstormed 2 ideas with my partner. The first idea was the creation of an moblie app using swift. This app could be a reminder, story, or any app that was useful for students. The second idea was the creation of a open 2d pixel game where users would go through a series of story quests that involved beating opponents or solving an secret puzzle using goDot. Utiately we came to an agreement for creating our second idea as it seemed more fun to learn. From there, we started to tinker with our tool, which was goDot. 
I first read the dosucmentation, and introduction on the goDot website to learn more about how the engine works and where I can begin. Afterwards, I started their specifially created lessons called GDscript from zero to learn how to code in gdscript. I went through each lessons to learn the main concepts, and coding I would need. The first lesson taught the general infomtion about coding; why and how we code. The second lesson taught me why errors are good but also introduced us to a tool installed in goDot that helps explain an error message. In addition, from that we practiced fixing an error in an function. Moving on, the third lesson taught us that how to use specific functions in Gdscpit such as show(), hide(), move_local_x(), move_local_y(), and rotate(). For example, in the picture below, we learned that by using show() will make an onject that was invisible show, and rotate() would make an object roatate by a certain degree to the left or to right. In addition, we learned that gdScipt is different from regular coding lanagues as the syntax is a bit different. 

```
func run():
    show()
    rotate(0.3)
```

In the next lesson; lesson 4; we were taught how to move something using move_forward(), turn_right(), turn_left(). We were tasked with making an rectangle, and drawing an corner using these commands. Below is what I did

```
func draw_rectangle():
    move_forward(220)
    turn_right(90)
    move_forward(260)
    turn_right(90)
    move_forward(220)
    turn_right(90)
    move_forward(260)
    turn_right(90)
```

I wrote my own code in Gdscipt so that I could create an rectangle using the fnctions I had learned. In the last lesson
