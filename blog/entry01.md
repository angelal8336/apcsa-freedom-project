For this year's freedom project, I decided to create a open world game revolved around a mini version of society that involves farming, beating opponments, and stories with my partner Shelly. It will be a game similar to stardew village, as it was part of inspiration. I want to create this game using the tool, goDot. goDot is a free game engine that allows for pixeled creation in 2D or 3D. The reason I picked this appilcation was because one, I was intested in creating pixel games, and two it was the only engine that caught my attention. When I first started this freedom project, I was made to choose what I wanted to create, and what tool I would want to use. I brainstormed 2 ideas with my partner. The first idea was the creation of an moblie app using swift. This app could be a reminder, story, or any app that was useful for students. The second idea was the creation of a open 2d pixel game where users would go through a series of story quests that involved beating opponents or solving an secret puzzle using goDot. Utiately we came to an agreement for creating our second idea as it seemed more fun to learn. From there, we started to tinker with our tool, which was goDot.
