### Context
After setting goals for winterbreak and above, we got to learning our tool which is GoDot. Our goal for this break was to get more fimilar with GoDot engine, and the sections/conpomnents that make up the engine such as filesystem, scenes, and inspector. We wanted to understand and learn the engine (not the code), and how to use the tools in GoDot to create a protyope of our game. Our freedom project is to create a 2D pixel game that simulates real life; trading, buying and selling with a hint of magical elements such monsters. Like the last blog, this blog will focus on how we learned our tool this month. 

### Progress
Putting a pause to learning GDscript, we wanted to become more fimialrized with how to actually use the engine in creating our game. Unlike other applications I have tried such as kaboom, the world, spriits, and items will not be created using code. To start off on my learning, I first downloaded the engine through the goDot website, downloading it to my files in my computer. From there, I opened it up, and explored the engine, to understand what each tool and section does and how I can use it to create my 2D pixel game. On that day, for about 1 hour all I did was tinker and mess with the engine, clicking on random stuff to get a brief understanding of what I was doing. To be honest, the engine itself was very overwhelmiing, so I decided to watch a video () on the beginner guide on using the engine. From that video, I learned quite alot ranging from inspector and filesystem, to all kinds nodes and scenes. The first thing I familkiarzed myself with is the concept behind creating something in goDot. In goDot everything is conprised of nodes, which is individual parts of a object or what we called scenes in goDot, such as the physics of a character. When you combine multiple types of nodes, you create one scene such as a coin object that can be used in a bigger scene such as a world map. This is estenlly how games in goDot are created: nodes -- scenes --> game. When I understood this, everything became easier including learning each tool in goDot. Instead of explaining what I learned, a picture below is shown that shows my interpeation of each major section in the engine:
