# APCSA Freedom Project
by Angela Liu

## Context
I am a student at [HSTAT](https://www.hstat.org/) in the [Software Engineering Program](https://hstatsep.github.io/). The "Freedom Project" for AP Computer Science A is a year-long project all about making anything using technology.

For my project, I chose to independently study [goDot](https://godotengine.org/) in order to help me make a 3D survival game in which the player has to kill as much mobs as possible but also survive without dying. The player can move using WASD, jump using the space bar, sprint using shift and lastly hit using a right click. Monsters will spawn in continuous and follow you, until you kill it by hitting it a few times. However, you take damage as a result. When your health is zero, you lose and you are brought to another screen. This game was created by me and Shelly and we used outside tools like [assets stores](https://kenney.nl/assets?t=godot) to create scenes and also [github](https://github.com/) to work together. 
The purpose of creating this game was to cure boredom but also just for fun and throughout the blog we went over the whole process and challenges we faced to end up here.
