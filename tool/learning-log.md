### 10/6/24:
* I read the introduction for goDot and learned what goDot is, what engine, and how to start using it
  * goDot is an free game creating platform that allows you to create 2d and 3d games using GDscript which stands for Godot script
  * There are many sources of recourses to use such as watching Gdquest, and viewing websites like gdscript.com

* I did the beginner tutorial called learn GDscript from zero to learn how to code in gdscript.
  * Lesson 1: States why we code, how we code, and basically general information about coding.
  * Lesson 2: Learns why errors are good, and a tool installed in goDot that helps explain an error message. In addition, we practiced fixing an error in an function
  * Lesson 3: Learned how to use functions like `show()`, `hide()`, `move_local_x()`, `move_local_y()`, and `rotate()`
    * `show()` makes something visible, and `hide()` makes something invisible; no need arguments
    * `move_local_x()` and `move_local_y()` moves something by # of pixels; one argument
    * rotate() rotates something; one argument
    * In GoDot we must use an exisiting function inside of an custom function
      * To create an function in GDscipt, you write `func name():`
      * Learned what an agrument is 
  * Lesson 4: Learned how to move something using `move_forward()`, `turn_right()`, `turn_left()`
    * *these function only works in learn GDscript from zero, and not actually in goDot*
  * Lesson 5: Coded my own function using GDscript
    * You create a function using func, name, colons, and then :
    * Each line of code inside a function MUST be indented
